		<h3>ActiveDrive - Drowsiness Detection System</h3>

		<p>This was my Final Year Project during my time at NUST, it was a system designed to detect driver fatigue levels using facial features captured by a dashboard camera, which were then fed to a pre-trained Neural Network.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system consisted of a Nvidia Jetson Nano Development Board which was running a pre-Trained MobileNet architecture trained on a dataset of 5000+ images.
		<br>
		<br>
		A camera would capture a live videofeed of the driver, where each frame would now be fed to the neural network running in the Jetson computer, a prediction would be made for each frame. If consequetive frames were predicted to be drowsy, then an alarm would be sounded off to alert the driver.
		<br>
		<br>
		The project also included a mobile application, where the driver can be notified on the phone as well through a mobile app, as well as a FireBase Database where data regarding previous warnings issued to the driver would be stored.
